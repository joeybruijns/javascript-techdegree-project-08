**How to run this project:** in your terminal go to the project directory and run `npm start` to run this project.

**Summary:** 
It this project we'll be creating an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, we'll build a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. Based on HTML designs and an existing SQLite database, we'll implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
